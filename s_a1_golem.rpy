    "Finally, through the trees, you spot a weathered structure, sagging under the weight of moss and ivy."
    "The door is closed, though the building feels alive with a strange energy."
    "As your hand touches the door's handle, the wood seems to shift, warping and stretching unnaturally."
    "Tendrils of something—wood, metal, or perhaps something else—curl around you, pulling you inside before you can react."
    "You blink, and you're standing in the dim, dusty interior."
    "The smell of old wood and stale air mingles with the sharp tang of boiling cabbage."
    "Candles flicker weakly in the corners, casting trembling shadows across the room."
    "Shattered chairs and broken tables are scattered about, their remains little more than skeletal shapes barely clinging to form."
    "A counter sits at the far end, its shelves lined with dusty, opaque bottles."
    "The air feels heavy, almost watchful."
    "A narrow staircase draws your eye, and you ascend slowly, the wooden steps groaning under your weight."
    "The upper floor is eerily still."
    "The corridor stretches ahead, lined with rooms, each door either smashed open or hanging crookedly from broken hinges."
    "Despite the decay, the floor is oddly clean, the dust and debris swept into careful piles along the walls, leaving a clear path forward."
    "The sense of something unseen watching you grows stronger."

    i "Hey, I've never seen you before. Who are you?"

    "A sudden voice shatters the stillness, catching you off guard."
    "You stumble back a few steps, your eyes darting to a shadowy corner."
    "There, by the faint glow of a candle, sits a small figure, like a child but with an unsettling stillness, holding an open book."
    "As the initial shock wears off and your eyes adjust to the dim light, you begin to make out more details."

    "The figure's skin is a gleaming brown, almost polished, and its thin, lanky frame is made more striking by the impossibly slender proportions of its limbs."
    "Its head is round, without a visible mouth or nose, just two large, opaque black eyes that reflect the flickering candlelight."
    "The figure closes the book, standing with a strange grace, and places it on a nearby shelf."

    menu:
        "Explain how Stavros pointed you in this direction.":
            "The figure's eyes seem to brighten at your words, its expressionless face somehow conveying excitement."
            i "Oh, the old knight! He's a good man, I'm glad he sent you."

        "Explain that you stumbled upon this place by accident.":
            "The figure tilts its head, its eyes narrowing slightly as if considering your words."
            i "Accident? That's strange. This place isn't easy to find by chance."

    "You look cold, though. Come with me!"

    "Despite the lack of movement in its features, the voice is crisp and clear, as if spoken directly into your mind."
    "The figure gestures for you to follow and strides downstairs, its movements fluid and purposeful."

    "You descend the stairs after it, entering what was once the kitchen of the old establishment."
    "A cast iron pot hangs over the stove, gently steaming, while bits of vegetables are scattered around a worn table where a knife and cutting board rest."
    "The figure moves swiftly, retrieving a cup from under the counter and filling it with milk from a jug."
    "With ease, it scoops some soup from the pot into a horn bowl and places both the bowl and cup in front of you."

    i "Here. The old man always said when you're cold, you should eat and drink something warm."

    "The figure hands you a bowl, then settles on the floor, watching you with its unblinking eyes, its head slightly tilted as if waiting for your reaction."

    i "So, how is it?"

    "You take a bite with a cracked spoon, the warmth of the cabbage and milk spreading through you."
    "There's no salt, and the overpowering taste of pepper lingers, but it's comforting in its simplicity."

    menu:
        "It's good, just needs some more adjustments.":
            "You can't quite explain it, but the figure's face seems to brighten."
            i "Really? I'm so happy! I try cooking, but I can't taste the food and I'm always alone, so I never know if it's any good."
            
        "It's filling, but it could use some salt.":
            "You can't quite explain it, but the figure's face seems to brighten."
            i "Really? I'm so happy! I try cooking, but I can't taste the food and I'm always alone, so I never know if it's any good."
            
        "It's... It's food, at least.":
            "You notice the figure's expression subtly fall, though you can't understand how."
            i "I'm sorry. I try cooking, but I can't taste the food and I'm always alone, so I never know if it's any good."

    i "But enough about that. What were you doing before? I could sense you were in a bad situation."

    menu:
        "explain how you have little memories of what led you here.":

        "Ask why it's alone in this building. It doesn't seem a great place to be.":

        "Inquire more about the old man it mentioned.":

        "Ask about how it managed to take you here.":
