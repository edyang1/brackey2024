    fox "Yo, uber for..."
    fox "[f_name]?"

    "You whirl around, and there, out of nowhere, is the two-tailed fox, lounging like this whole thing isn't a big deal."

    menu:
        "Wait... you?! What are you doing here?!":
            fox "Bro, where else would I be? I live here. Well... lived."

    "The fox grins, giving a casual shrug, like losing a whole universe is just another Tuesday."

    fox "So, uh, yeah. This totally blows. No trees, no magic forest, no neon-lit streets to stroll around. Just... this."

    fox "But hey, we still got each other, right? Could be worse."

    "The fox glances around the void like its sizing up some empty real estate."

    fox "So, I guess the universe kinda... imploded? Guess thats what happens when youre too indecisive, huh?"

    menu:
        "I didnt—It wasnt—I couldnt choose!":
            fox "Ugh, you totally blew it, dude! You had one job! I'm actually gonna crash out."
    
    fox "..."

    fox "Sorry dude. I get it. Tough choice."
    fox "Nah, I wouldnt wanna deal with that either. But… here we are. Poof. Everything's gone."

    "..."

    "The foxs tails flicker faintly behind him, but theres nothing left for them to affect."

    fox "Well, the good news is that I still got my magic. Just nowhere to use it."

    "He looks down at his paws, flexing his claws, as though testing if his powers still work."

    fox "But hey, Im not mad. Were just in a... transitional phase. Y'know, moving on to new things, right?"

    menu:
        "Weren't you mad a minute ago?":
            fox "Stages of grief, bro. You've never been to therapy?"

    "The fox gives you a playful nudge with one of his glowing tails, like he's trying to cheer you up."

    fox "Cmon, you know the drill. We wander around, figure out where the next big adventure is."
    "Or maybe well find a nice spot and just vibe. Who knows?"

    fox "But lets be real. I'm magic, you're… well, you. Well be fine. Don't worry, I'll handle it."
    fox "The universe—or whatever comes next—cant be any worse than this, right?"
    fox "I mean, lowkey, what comes next?"

    "The fox hops up, his energy suddenly brighter despite the bleak surroundings."

    fox "Lets keep it chill. Well find something new. Maybe another magical forest?"
    fox "A futuristic city? Hell, Ill settle for a Chipotle at this point."

    "He extends his paw, flashing you a grin."

    menu:
        "Dap him up.":
            fox "Next time, just save the forest, dude."
