    fox "Yo, uber for..."
    fox "[f_name]?"

    "You whirl around, and there, out of nowhere, is the two-tailed fox, lounging like this whole thing isn't a big deal."

    menu:
        "Wait... you?! What are you doing here?!":
            fox "Bruh where else would I be? I live here. Well... lived."

    "The fox grins."

    fox "So, uh, yeah. This totally blows. No trees, no magic forest, no neon-lit streets to stroll around. Just... this."

    fox "But hey, we still got each other, right? Could be worse."

    "The fox glances around the void like its sizing up some empty real estate."

    fox "So, I guess the universe kinda... imploded? Guess thats what happens when you're too indecisive, huh?"

    menu:
        "I didnt—It wasnt—I couldnt choose!":
            fox "Ugh, you totally blew it, dude! You had one job! I'm actually gonna crash out."
    
    fox "..."

    fox "Sorry dude. I get it. Tough choice."
    fox "Nah, I wouldnt wanna deal with that either. But… here we are. Poof. Everything's gone."
    fox "Turns out, literally being spirit of a forest doesn't make you immune to getting sent to the shadow realm."

    "..."

    "The foxs tails flicker faintly behind him, but theres nothing left for them to affect."

    fox "Well, the good news is that I still got my magic. Just nowhere to use it."

    "He looks down at his paws, flexing his claws, as though testing if his powers still work."

    fox "But hey, Im not mad. Were just in a... transitional phase. Y'know, moving on to new things...type stuff?"

    menu:
        "Weren't you mad a minute ago?":
            fox "Stages of grief, bro. You've never been to therapy?"

    "The fox gives you a playful nudge with one of his glowing tails, like he's trying to cheer you up."

    fox "Cmon, you know the drill. We wander around, figure out where the next big adventure is."
    fox "Or maybe we'll find a nice spot and just vibe. Who knows?"

    fox "But lets be real. I'm magic, you're… well, you."
    fox "Hey, I meant that in a nice way! You're cool. We're cool. We'll be fine."
    fox "Don't worry, I'll handle it."
    fox "The universe—or whatever comes next—cant be any worse than this, right?"
    fox "I mean, lowkey, if you think about it, what comes next?"

    "The fox hops up, his energy suddenly brighter despite the bleak surroundings."

    fox "Lets keep it chill. Well find something new. Maybe another magical forest?"
    fox "A futuristic city? Hell, I'll settle for a Chipotle at this point."
    fox "Now that I think about it, I could mess up some Chipotle right now."
    fox "But if they don't fill my bowl to the top, I'm gonna—"
    fox "There's some words I would share with them."
    fox "They better load that thing up."
    fox "Anyway, lets go find something new."

    "He extends his paw, flashing you a grin."

    menu:
        "Dap him up.":
            fox "Next time, just choose to save Everdusk, dude."
