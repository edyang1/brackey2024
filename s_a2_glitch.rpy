    "You once again find yourself wandering the towering streets of the Everdusk Sector, dwarfed by endless buildings and artificial suns."
    "Your restless desire for exploration pushes you forward, just as it did in the mountains—alone, searching for something beyond these looming shadows."
    "What once felt alien now feels familiar. The flashing lights, the sharp hum of powerlines, the mechanical hum of vehicles—it all blends into the rhythm of the city, a living organism breathing beneath your feet."

    "The colors, the noise—they no longer assault your senses. You've learned to tolerate the overwhelming pulse of this place."
    "The Everdusk nightlife surrounds you, though the lack of a visible sky leaves you uncertain of the time. Is it even night?"

    "{b}WARNING: Memory fragmentation at address 0xF3A5{/b}"

    "A narrow alley catches your eye."

    "Steam rises from a nearby vent, lingering unnaturally low, swirling like a coiled serpent."
    "Your chest tightens as familiar memories surge—memories of this fog, this exact sensation. It pulls you in."

    "As the fog thickens, reality itself seems to distort. Signs dissolve into grids of grey squares, buildings blur and stretch."

    "The city's hum fractures into chaotic screeches that pierce your skull."

    "{b}MEMORY DUMP: Segment violation at 0xA7B2F. Core dumped.{/b}"

    "Staggering out of the fog, you're struck by a biting wind. The neon lights, the towering buildings—they're gone."
    "Instead, the dry mountain air fills your lungs. Trees loom ahead, but they don't feel real, their shapes shifting in your vision."

    "Beneath your feet, the ground crumbles unnervingly, each step echoing with a hollow, discordant sound."

    "You move forward, but the forest feels wrong—unnatural. The trees shift like flat, painted panels, moving out of sync with the rest of the world."
