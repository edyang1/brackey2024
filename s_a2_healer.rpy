    "The kaleidoscope of lights and sounds was drowned out by a sudden, encroaching blackness that consumed you just as you lay inside the white puff of cloth."
    "You have scarce memories of people yelling something and more vehicles moving around you."
    "Not understanding much, you do however remember the canopy being opened up and someone grabbing you."

    "You come back to your senses on a short bed,"
    "surrounded by beeping contraptions you are hooked to via a tube and a cable placed on your left arm."
    "You feel some pain in your head and legs and can spot bandaging around your shins and feet."
    "The room is not spacious, but cozy enough to be in."
    "What personal belongings you had, not much really—"
    "perhaps just a slim rectangular appliance and a small plastic card—have been placed in a box next to your bed."
    "You don't feel pain, but you are far from your peak form."
    "Your head swings from side to side sometimes, and you have trouble focusing on more than one thing at a time."

    "A pleasant smell breaks your concentration, shifting your attention from the box to a tray left at your side."
    "A dish with spindly, yellowish threads sits under a transparent lid, not fully locked, the cover clouded with moisture."
    "You sense onions and see thick juice pooling underneath the strands."
    "You grab the dish and the fork left beside it, indulging in the meal."

    cal "Glad you woke up so soon."

    "A voice calls out from the doorframe."
    "Looking up from your food, strands of noodles hanging off your fork, you meet the gaze of a tall, thin woman."
    "She's dressed in work fatigues, a white patch on her right arm."
    "Her fingers are mechanic, sharp-looking, and parts of her face have been replaced with sleek cyber enhancements,"
    "color-matching her bright ashen hair."
    "Yet, despite the cold metal, her features radiate warmth, a relaxing shine that eases you."
    "She moves closer, checking the monitors of the machines you're connected to."
    "She chuckles when she notices how you're enjoying the meal."
    "You realize just how starving you feel."

    "The woman smiles."

    cal "I'm happy you like them."
    cal "They're from the restaurant down the street."
    cal "I eat them all the time—they're quite cheap and absolutely delicious."
    cal "They're called noodles."

    "The woman chuckles softly."

    cal "I could tell you were starving from the sound your stomach made as we brought you in after the car crash."
    cal "Figured you'd enjoy something like noodles to help you recover."

    "She gives you a quick glance over, then flashes a warm, almost motherly smile."

    cal "By the way, I'm Doctor Callie Wollerback, but you can just call me Callie."
