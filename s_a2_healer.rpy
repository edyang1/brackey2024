    "The room is not spacious, but cozy enough to be in."
    "What personal belongings you had, not much really—"
    "perhaps just a slim rectangular appliance and a small plastic card—have been placed in a box next to your bed."
    "You don't feel pain, but you are far from your peak form."
    "Your head swings from side to side sometimes, and you have trouble focusing on more than one thing at a time."

    "A pleasant smell breaks your concentration, shifting your attention from the box to a tray left at your side."
    "A dish with spindly, yellowish threads sits under a transparent lid, not fully locked, the cover clouded with moisture."
    "You sense onions and see thick juice pooling underneath the strands."
    "You grab the dish and the fork left beside it, indulging in the meal."
