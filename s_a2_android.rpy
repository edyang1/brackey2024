    "The street corner is steeped in shadow, occasionally disrupted by the flicker of neon lights and the soft hum of electric signs above."
    "Under the concrete maze of buildings and archways, the small street feels almost forgotten,"
    "a quiet respite in an otherwise busy city."
    "The silicate-heavy urban air fills your lungs,"
    "and the ever-present hum of the city thrums in your ears as you approach a lone door,"
    "the vehicle having parked itself in front of it."
    "As you step closer, the littered remains of packaging, news sheets, and urban debris crunch beneath your feet."
    "From behind, you hear a strange beeping noise coming from the car."
    "Two red dots blink to life on the door as you near, and a voice crackles from an intercom next to the handle."
    
    b "It's you, isn't it? Got Star's message. Come in."

    "The door slides open, revealing a short, sharp-turning corridor bathed in bright light."
    "The door seals itself behind you with a mechanical hiss."
    "You follow the corridor, rounding the corner to another door at the far end."
    "Two soft green dots pulse steadily as you approach."
    "When you open the door, you're greeted by a small, well-organized apartment."
    "The shutters are drawn, casting the room in muted light."
    "A desk is piled high with snacks and vending machine baubles."
    "The furniture is sparse, and the open dressers reveal no clothes or personal belongings."
    "Your attention is drawn to a figure seated at the desk, their back turned to you,"
    "a red hoodie draped over their metallic form."
    "They're tinkering with something on the desk,"
    "but their awareness of your arrival is clear as the door slides shut behind you."

    b "The Office must still be in the dark if someone like you can find me."

    "The voice is soft, almost mechanical, as the figure swivels around in the chair."
    "You realize quickly—they're not human."
    "Metallic limbs glint under the hoodie, attached to a torso concealed by the red fabric."
    "The android's head is a black square screen, two bright white dots serving as eyes that track your every movement."

    b "Well? Are you going to say something?"

    "The android's tone sharpens slightly as it regards your silence. Its left 'eye' stretches upwards,"
    "while the right one shrinks, an expression of... curiosity? You can almost hear the transistors whirring inside."
    "A moment later, the eyes widen back to their original shape, now adorned with white lines that mimic eyebrows, moving in tandem with the pupils."

    b "Oh, I know what you need! Come here."

    "The android rolls over to the vending pile,"
    "grabbing a CannonBall fizzy drink and two Super Beams chocolate bars—banana and whole nuts."
    "Your stomach growls as you accept the snacks, popping open the can and unwrapping the bars."
    "The sweet taste of the chocolate and the fizz of the drink hit your senses, grounding you in the moment."

            "Its eyes narrow as a soft whirring fills the air—its processors working overtime."
