    "The wind hits your body before the light fades entirely."
    "You stumble, collapsing onto the dark, cold earth beneath you. When your eyes open, the world rushes back into view."
    "Mighty peaks stretch toward the sky, soft hills rolling endlessly in the distance."
    "Above, a striped kestrel slices through the air with unmatched grace and speed."

    "You blink, taking a sharp breath. Your legs, your arms, your chest—they're all here. You feel whole."
    "You jolt upright, sitting up as the reality of your return hits you."

    "The icy gusts claw at your exposed skin, biting and stinging, but you welcome the chill with a quiet smile."
    "It's the most beautiful thing you've ever felt."

    "With trembling hands, you dig into the earth beneath you, clawing at the damp soil as if to reassure yourself that this world is real."
    "The scent of wet dirt fills your lungs, grounding you, centering you."

    "You stand, unsteady but determined, your eyes wide as you take in the landscape."
    "It's as if you can't get enough, like a man starved and desperate for sustenance."
    "This world is real. This world is safe."

    "But something nags at the back of your mind. You can't rest, not yet."
    "Not until you know what happened to the people you've met, to the ones who shared this journey with you."
